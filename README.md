# Network_Pharmacology_Pipeline
A workflow of network pharmacology, where the first half involves processing file data using Python, and the second half involves visualization using R.

NOTE: GitHub often experiences issues loading ipynb files. To resolve this, open the link for `Network_Pharmacology_Pipeline.ipynb` (e.g.,https://github.com/changecool/Network_Pharmacology_Pipeline/blob/main/Network_Pharmacology_Pipeline.ipynb), copy it into the search box of [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/), and click the GO button. This will allow online viewing of `Network_Pharmacology_Pipeline.ipynb`.

In addition, this document is written using VScode with two programming languages, Python and R. Language kernels need to be manually switched during the process.

All operation steps and requirements have been explained in the `Network_Pharmacology_Pipeline.ipynb` file.
